  ### Week 4: Microcontroller Programming

  This week we learned about Microcontroller programming, specifically with the Arduino interface. In previous weeks, we were able to use the Arduino board in conjunction with a breadboard to power LEDs and motors. However, without programming, there was no good way to control specific behavior with the LEDs or motors; it was a simple on/off control situation situation.

  Now, with the introduction of programming, we can control our output pins with much more percision to get any behavior we desire. We can use logic constructs to manipulate the amount of current we provide to the output chanels (and even use techniques such as pulse width modulation to get precise, nonbinary values) and control components.

  For this weeks assignment, I decided to go back to the basics with controlling LEDs and do it in a more interesting way. 

  First, I set up an array of LEDs, all of which are connected to pins 2-6 then to a resistor and ground.

  Normally, this would be a boring setup with 5 lit up LEDs in a row. But we can spice things up and make the LED light up in waves.

  First, I initialized a few global variables I will be using:

  ![initialization of global variables](./global_variables.png)

  Then, I wrote code for the setup() block. This is the code that runs once at the very beginning. For this simple program, we only need to initialize all the pins we will be using as output pins and then turn the pins to LOW mode, which will simply turn off the LEDs at each pin. One useful trick to avoid copying and pasting code for each pin is to just run a for loop to go through pins 2-6. The downside of this method however is that it only works for consective pins in sequence. This limited me from using analog writing to have more control over the LEDs with PWM and only allowed for digital writing of off and on as the PWM capable pins are not in a consecutive row. However, we can still get some neat behaviors by playing with sequencing and speed.

  Now comes the loop() code block:

  ![loop code](./loop_v1.png)

  This code simply turns on and off an LED in a certain sequence with set amounts of delay. The order set by the for loops iterates from pin 2 to 6 and then backwards starting with 5 to 3 (goes from 5-3 instead of 6-2 to prevent the end LEDs from flashing twice in every sequence). From here the loop starts over again into 2-6 back to 5-3.
  
  But I wanted to add a tiny bit of complexity by playing around with the speed at which the wave of lights move. This was done by setting a variable called "delay_time" and then changing this a bit in every loop like so:

  ![loop code v2](./loop_v2.png)

  With this additional code, the delay between LED activations increases and decreases linearly between the set min and max delays. Once the min or max value is reached, the sign value of fadeAmount is reverse to start changing the delay in the opposite direction. 

  This code leads to this final product:

  Much more interesting than just turning LEDs on!

  [The logic for changing the fadeAmount came from this beginner Arduino tutorial: https://www.programmingelectronics.com/tutorial-10-fade-an-led-with-pulse-width-modulation-using-analogwrite/]
