  ### Week 2: Introduction into Fusion360 + Electronics

  This week we got an introduction to Computer Assisted Design with Fusion360. This was my first time using this type of software, so it was a bit tricky. However, I found it easier after watching a few tutorials and focusing only on figuring out the tools necessary to make a specific object. Having a goal in mind makes the complexity get easier to manage.

  In particular, I attempted to model a shampoo container and a tissue box. Here are the results:

  We also learned about press-fit construction. By creating sketches in Fusion360, we can precisely laser cut pieces of cardboard in such a way that they fit together into a constructionâ€”no glue or tape necessary!


  I wanted to create a construction of a dinosaur, specifically a brachiosaurus (the giraffe looking one). The inspiration for the design came after extensive google searching and eventually stumbling across this puzzle set.

  There is only one image of the kit, but the simple design is easy to understand and replicate myself (why spend $24.95 before tax when you can use a laser printer?). I went into Fusion360 and started a new project. From there, I created separate sketches for each part I needed. In my case, I needed one main body which includes the neck and head, two identical side pieces to represent the legs, and two connection pieces to orthogonally connect the pieces together. 

  To achieve the design, I primarily used the fit point spline to draw the design of the dinosaur, giving my best artist rendition of a brachiosaurus. Afterward, I created my notches using offsets. It was important to incorporate parametric design to scale the notches. This is because I needed to incorporate factors such as the width of the cardboard and the kerf when setting the measurements of the notches. Using parameters makes these measurements easy to adjust as I did not know the exact width of the cardboard or kerf of the laser cutting when making the design. 

  This is what is looks in Fusion 360:

  From there, I extruded the parts I wanted and exported to a dxf file to load into the laser cutter. After some cutting and adjustments, this is the final product:
