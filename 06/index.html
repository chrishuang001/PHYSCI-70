<xmp theme="journal" style="display:none;">

  This week, we were working with electrical input devices.

One fundamental function to do almost anything of substance when it comes to interactive and dynamic machines is the ability to take in information and data from the real world such that we can process and respond to our desired action or nonaction.

(It would simply be quite boring if every single action is explicitly predetermined while we write up our code.)

This form of input comes usually in the form of sensors. Sensors are specialized devices that take in information from the environment and convert that into a digital format so we can process it with our computers. Some of the sensors we have in our lab include sensors that detect temperature, force, magnetic fields, sound, light, acceleration, and more!

For this week’s assignment, I will be taking in input with a capacitive sensor and exploring a sensor I have not used before.

The first step is to create a capacitive sensor to measure the physical quantity of my design. I attempted to create a sensor to measure the amount of liquid within a cup. I hypothesized that this may help in some iteration of my final project where instead of keeping track of the volume of water, there is some subsystem to make sure that cups of paint are full for the robot to use.

Though as my first exploration, I will work on a simpler version to detect water content in a cup first, and I presume that this can be tuned to paint later on.

I set up the wiring of a simple capacitive sensor. This required only three wires, one alligator clip, one piece of copper, one resistor, and two pins on the Arduino UNO–one for sending and one for receiving.

I made use of the capacitive sensor library, following this guide:
https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/CapacitiveTouch/index.html

The code is very simple and looks like this:
<pre><code>
    #include <CapacitiveSensor.h>

    CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(4, 2);

    long val;

    void setup() {

      Serial.begin(9600);

    }

    void loop() {

      val = Sensor.capacitiveSensor(30);  
      Serial.println(val);
      delay(250);

    }
</code></pre>
And it works! (I know its blurry trust me the numbers are going up when it is touched)

Then I attached the copper paper onto a cup and started filling it with water, noting the arduino sensor values at each benchmark.

Here is a table of the digital readings vs actual water content:


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Water Level</th>
    <th>Arduino Reading</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 cup</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/4 cup</td>
    <td>39</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/2 cup</td>
    <td>48</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/4 cup</td>
    <td>55</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 cup</td>
    <td>58</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Looks like it is quite inaccurate especially at the lower and upper range. Reproducibility is also low when emptying and refilling. It seems that the measurement is both too inaccurate and sensitive to the ambient environment to provide reliable readings that would be needed for any useful application. As such, another method is most likely preferable, perhaps with a more sophisticated capacitance sensor or another sensor entirely.

For the second part of the project, I explored using a new sensor: a light sensor. No real reason behind this choice; I just thought it would be cool to play with! I followed this guide to get the sensor working: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-light-sensor


The way a light sensor works is that it acts as a variable resistor, which is why it is also called a photoresistor. Therefore, all we have to do is a set up a simple 5V to ground circuit while reading the resistance at a specific point:

This is a table of the digital readings vs the relative amount of light


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Light Level</th>
    <th>Arduino Reading</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Phone flash light</td>
    <td>478</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ambient Classroom</td>
    <td>276</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Covered lightly by hand</td>
    <td>120</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Completely covered by jacket</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>

</table>

Seems like the readings from the photoresistor are much more reliable than the capcitance sensor, and it would be great to use in more precise applications where light level is needed.
