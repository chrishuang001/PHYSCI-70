  ### Week 1: Final Project Proposal

  My artistic career peaked early in life when I was awarded possibly one of the most prestigious awards: Most Artistic in Middle School

  Admittedly, the competition for the boy recipient of this award at my small school was sparse… and the piece that won this award was a drawing which I traced (damn well mind you). But it was a great accomplishment nonetheless!

  My artistic skills have waned since then, but I firmly believe that is no excuse for not being able to create Mona Lisa’s out of thin air. After all, it would not be a sane world where just because you are a bad painter means you cannot create beautiful paintings. 

  Introducing… Rembr-bot Harmenszoon van Rijn, the painting robot  (name to be workshopped)

  Part 1: A program, most likely needing to use some machine learning technique, takes an image and produces an artistic rendition of it. Then, outputs a series of colored strokes needed to create that rendition

  Part 2: A machine translates the computed series of strokes into real life paint strokes. Possible ideas include a more standard robotic arm programmed to do some inverse kinematics, a CNC machine to hold a paint brush, or some other custom solution.

  Part 3: Make a grand entrance into the world of high art, selling Rembr-bot’s paintings for millions of dollars.
